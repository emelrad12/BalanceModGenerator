Simple tool to generate mods based on some rules, so you dont have to manually fix all your mods each game version, but simply regen them.

Currently it is very barebones, and using hardcoded paths, wip

Currently the program.cs contains my mod, so you can look at it, to see how it works.

To use simply clone and edit the program.cs(and fix the paths)
